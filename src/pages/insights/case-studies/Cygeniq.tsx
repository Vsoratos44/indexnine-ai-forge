              The Challenge: Securing the New Attack Surface of Generative AI
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-foreground-dark leading-relaxed mb-8">
              The proliferation of generative AI in the enterprise has created a paradigm shift, unlocking unprecedented productivity. However, it has also opened a new, insidious, and largely undefended attack surface. Traditional cybersecurity tools, built for a world of predictable code and deterministic systems, are fundamentally blind to the threats posed by Large Language Models (LLMs).
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-foreground-dark leading-relaxed mb-8">
              For Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), this represents a new nightmare scenario. They are now responsible for securing "black box" systems whose behavior can be unpredictable, making it nearly impossible to apply conventional security protocols.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-foreground-dark leading-relaxed mb-8">
              The founders of CygenIQ, veterans of the cybersecurity industry, saw this impending crisis not as a problem, but as a market-defining opportunity. Their vision was to build a first-of-its-kind platform that could effectively "police other AIs," giving enterprises the visibility and control needed to adopt generative AI safely. They had the vision and the deep domain expertise, but faced a critical business challenge: they needed to move from their validated idea to a functional, high-fidelity prototype to secure their next round of funding and kickstart development.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-foreground-dark leading-relaxed">
              They required more than a design agency; they needed a strategic product engineering partner who could deliver with velocity without sacrificing qualityâ€”a partner who could internalize their complex vision and translate it into a clear, buildable plan that would get investors excited and developers moving.
