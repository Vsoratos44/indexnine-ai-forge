                    The generative AI revolution, led by technologies like
                    ChatGPT, has been a double-edged sword for the enterprise.
                    While it has unlocked unprecedented productivity, it has
                    also created a new, invisible, and highly dangerous attack
                    surface. Malicious actors are no longer just targeting
                    networks and applications; they are targeting the AI models
                    themselves through techniques like prompt injection, model
                    poisoning, and the deployment of malicious agentic
                    workflows.

                    The founders of CygenIQ, veterans of the cybersecurity
                    industry, recognized this paradigm shift. They saw that
                    existing security toolsâ€”firewalls, endpoint protection, even
                    traditional application security scannersâ€”were completely
                    blind to these new AI-native threats. A CISO could have a
                    perfectly secure network, yet their organization could be
                    critically vulnerable to data exfiltration through a
                    cleverly crafted prompt sent to an internal LLM-powered
                    application.

                    CygenIQ's vision was to build the security platform for this
                    new era. They needed to create a product that could detect
                    and mitigate the risks created by AI itself. This was a "do
                    or die" venture for the founders, with their own retirement
                    savings on the line.
