              The Challenge: The Paradox of Visibility in a Sprawling Digital Estate
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-lg text-foreground-dark leading-relaxed mb-8">
              The IT landscape is a chaotic one; applications and data are no longer confined exclusively to a secure, on-premise data center; they're distributed across hundreds of SaaS platforms like Salesforce and SAP, multiple cloud providers, and countless homegrown systems. For a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), this creates a nightmare scenario for managing who has access to what.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg text-foreground-dark leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Zilla Security was founded to solve just this problem. Their initial product was brilliant: an auditing tool that could connect to this fragmented digital estate and give CISOs a unified view of all user permissions, answering at a glance the fundamental, critical question of infosec: "Who has access to things they shouldn't?"
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-foreground-dark leading-relaxed mb-8">
              The product was a success. Zilla quickly acquired 100+ customers, including major enterprises like United Airlines. They'd successfully navigated the launch phase of their product lifecycle. But in doing so, they found a new challenge.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-primary mb-4 font-montserrat">The Critical Feedback</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-foreground-dark leading-relaxed italic">
                "This is great, you've shown me that I have security issues. Now, how do I fix them?"
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-foreground/60 mt-2">â€” Consistent customer feedback across 100+ enterprise clients</p>
            </div>

            <p className="text-lg text-foreground-dark leading-relaxed">
              Their customers loved the reports, but they all came back with the same feedback. With customers empowered to see problems instantaneously, they wanted a way to solve those problems just as fast. Zilla found itself with a product that could show customers their security problems. Now, they needed the product to offer security solutions. Until it was overcome, this customer friction could prove a roadblock to continued growth and a potential threat to the company's long-term viability. They were at a strategic inflection point and needed a partner with the technical depth and product development expertise to help them navigate their next move.

                    Moving from a system that reports on permissions to one that changes them is an order-of-magnitude increase in technical complexity. It required us to architect and build a secure, scalable, and resilient provisioning engine from the ground up. This involved solving several substantial challenges:

                      <p className="text-sm text-foreground-muted">The engine needed to communicate with hundreds of disparate third-party systems. This meant architecting a highly extensible integration framework capable of handling modern REST APIs, legacy SOAP APIs, and everything in between.</p>

                      <p className="text-sm text-foreground-muted">The system had to guarantee that when a user's access was revoked, it was revoked across all target systems. We implemented a sophisticated, transactional state management architecture with robust rollback capabilities.</p>

                      <p className="text-sm text-foreground-muted">As a security product that would be granted privileged access to a client's most sensitive systems, the provisioning engine itself had to be a fortress with least-privilege access, end-to-end encryption, and comprehensive audit logging.</p>
