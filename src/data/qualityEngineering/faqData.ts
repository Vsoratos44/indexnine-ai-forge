    question: "Can you use Robot Framework and Playwright together?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Robot Framework can use Playwright's engine directly through its modern Browser library. This is a popular and powerful combination that offers Robot's simple syntax with Playwright's speed and reliability.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Playwright better than Robot Framework for enterprise QA?",
    answer:
      "Playwright is often preferred for larger, developer-heavy enterprise teams due to its raw speed, native multi-language support, and advanced debugging features. However, Robot Framework's readability and extensibility make it a highly viable and scalable enterprise solution as well, especially in Python-centric environments.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What are the main differences between Robot Framework and Playwright?",
    answer:
      "The main differences are in their philosophy and primary user. Robot Framework uses a keyword-driven syntax designed for accessibility and collaboration. Playwright is a developer-first tool with a traditional coding syntax in multiple languages, built for maximum speed and efficiency within engineering workflows.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can you integrate Robot Framework with Playwright for hybrid testing?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Integrating Robot Framework with the Playwright-based Browser library is an advanced strategy for hybrid testing. It allows you to write simple, maintainable test cases that are executed by Playwright's powerful and reliable automation engine.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does this integrate with our existing development team?",
    answer:
      "Our model is collaborative. We work within your existing agile process, integrating directly with your developers in their environment (e.g., GitHub, Jira). Our goal is to empower your team by building systems they can own and extend long-term.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the typical ROI on a test automation project?",
    answer:
      "ROI is measured in several ways: reduced manual testing hours, decreased bug-fixing costs (by catching them earlier), and increased development velocity. During an APQ Roadmap, we build a specific ROI model based on your metrics to justify the investment.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to see results from test automation?",
    answer:
      "With our Sprint 0 approach, you'll see working automation within 2 weeks. Measurable ROI typically appears within 3-6 months as the automated tests accumulate saved hours and prevent costly production bugs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support legacy systems and older technologies?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our platforms are designed to work with both modern and legacy systems. We often help companies bridge the gap between old and new technology stacks while maintaining comprehensive test coverage.",
  },
